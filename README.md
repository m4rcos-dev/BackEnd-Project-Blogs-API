### [DEPLOY](https://LINK)

<p>Project developed during the back-end module of the Trybe full-stack web development course.</p>
<p>In this project an API and a database were developed to produce content for a blog.</p>
<p>A Node.js application using the sequelize package to do a CRUD of posts. Creating endpoints that are connected to the database following REST principles</p>


## üî® Project Resources

<ul>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint for user login, using the POST method.</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint for registering users, using the POST method.</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint for lists all registered users, using the GET method</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint for lists by id only a registered user, using the GET method</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint to delete logged in user, using the DELETE method</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint for post category registration, using the POST method.</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint for lists all categories of registered posts, using the GET method</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint for lists all registered posts, using the GET method</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint for lists by id just a registered post, using the GET method</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint for lists by query informed only a registered post that corresponds to the title or content of the post, using the GET method</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint for registering a new post, using the POST method.</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint to update an existing post, using the PUT method.</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint to delete an existing post, using the DELETE method</li>
<li>‚úÖTo make a post, you need a user and a login, so the relationship between the user and post tables is worked on</li>
<li>‚úÖIt is necessary to use categories for posts, thus working on the relationship between posts tables for categories and categories for posts</li>
</ul>

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running application
<details>
   <summary><strong>üêã Running on Docker vs Locally</strong></summary>

   ## üëâ With Docker

**‚ö†Ô∏è Before starting, your docker-compose needs to be at version 1.29 or higher. [See here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04-pt) or [in the documetation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)  how to install it. In the first article, you can replace where you are with `1.26.0` with `1.29.2`.**


> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Run the `node` and `db` services with the `docker-compose up -d --build` command.

   - Remember to stop `mysql` if you are using it locally on the default port (`3306`), or adapt it, if you want to use the application in containers;

   - These services will initialize a container named `blogs_api` and another named `blogs_api_db`;

   - From here you can run the `blogs_api` container via CLI or open it in VS Code;

   > ‚ÑπÔ∏è Use the command `docker exec -it blogs_api bash`.

   - It will give you access to the interactive terminal of the container created by compose, which is running in the background.

   > ‚ÑπÔ∏è Install dependencies [**If any**] with `npm install`. (Install inside the container)

   - **‚ö†Ô∏è Attention:** If you choose to use Docker, **ALL** the commands available in `package.json` (npm start, npm test, npm run dev, ...) must be executed **INSIDE ** of the container, that is, in the terminal that appears after executing the `docker exec` command mentioned above.

   - **‚ö†Ô∏è Attention:** The **git** inside the container is not configured with your credentials. Either commit outside the container, or set your git credentials inside the container.

   - **‚ö†Ô∏è Attention:** Do not run the npm audit fix command! It updates several project dependencies, and this update causes conflicts.

   - ‚ú® **Tip:** The `Remote - Containers` extension is indicated so that you can develop your application in the Docker container directly in VS Code, as you do with your local files.

   ## üëâ Without Docker

   > ‚ÑπÔ∏è Install dependencies [**If any**] with `npm install`

   - **‚ö†Ô∏è Attention:** Do not run the npm audit fix command! It updates several project dependencies, and this update causes conflicts.

   - **‚ú® Tip:** To run the project this way, you must have `node` installed on your computer.
